This is apparently fixed in 75.0.\n    Firefox 74.0 #32\n\n\nUsage\n\nThe addon's functionality can be toggled with the included button and is disabled by default. The button can be found by right-clicking a toolbar and choosing customize. It is labelled CorsE and has 3 states:\n\n    red, addon is disabled, CORS rules are upheld.\n    green, addon is enabled, CORS rules are bypassed.\n    green/red, addon is enabled and using the activation whitelist, CORS rules are bypassed when the origin url matches a filter in the whitelist.\n\n\nA basic CORS test is available in the repository at ./_test/cors-everywhere-test.html.\n\nIntended for developers. Use at your own risk.\n\nOptions\n\nAvailable in about:addons.\n\n    Enabled at startup Enables this addon on startup.\n    Force value of \"access-control-allow-origin\" Self explanatory.\n    Activation whitelist When the addon is enabled, this will check the origin url against the whitelist to decide if headers will be modified. Uses regular expressions.\n\n\nFAQ\n\nThe addon is enabled but the requests return content as if no user was logged in the target domain.
